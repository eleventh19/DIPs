# Overview 
## Summary of Proposal
The Grants & Impact Community Hub is a space where people can come discuss and learn about grant programs, mechanisms, the application process, and impact measurement. There will be a variety of talks and workshops for both operators and those who apply for grants. 

## Abstract
The Grants & Impact Community Hub brings together many of the top research and development organizations and individuals to host a series of discussions and workshops that can help builders build more sustainable projects and help the space broadly understand the outcomes and impact of our collective work.

# Motivation & Rationale
The motivation around this hub is that a) the vast majority of established organizations in the space feel the need to launch grant programs and b) that many early stage builders rely on grants to help them start or continue their journeys as they build new tools or products in the space. Despite that, the grant experience is often unpleasant, few programs support their grantees during the application process (and even fewer support once grants have been issued), and there is no clear definition of impact, which leads to a lack of clarity of what programs want in the long term beyond immediate growth. This combination of factors leads to inefficient capital allocation as well as user experiences that have a lot of room for improvement.

The goal of this hub would be to bring together granting organizations, researchers, and those building relevant tools to help improve the grant space. Collectively, we will be able to host a series of discussions and workshops to dive deep into and get closer to solving core problems that we face.

There are many people who will be applying to speak on the mainstage on some of these topics, so this space can serve a nice complement to the larger presentations and panels.

# Implementation
The Metagov team has run a variety of events bringing together grant operators and grantees in Denver and Bruseels. Many of the core facilitators (authors of this report) have been discussing grants in various capacities. 

A sample program could look something like the following:
Day 1 - Funder office hours
Give different grant programs and round operators office hours opportunities throughout the day
Day 2 - Helping grantees succeed
Doing a series of workshops and discussions meant to help grantees strengthen their proposals, increase their chance of success, and how thinking about outputs, outcomes, and impact will help them work more easily with grant programs
Day 3 - Impact, impact, impact (aka outputs, outcomes, impact)
Series of discussions and workshops getting into outputs/outcome/impact mapping
Explore some tools that can help us map impact
Day 4 - Sustainability beyond grants

Discussions and potentially some workshop delving into the type of funding channels projects can rely on at different stages of their growth (ranging from hackathons to grants to crowdfunding to formal VC investments)

The current group of Core Facilitators, those who will be planning the programming, arranging guests, and co-managing the space during the week represent orgs such as: Metagov, Grant Innovation Lab, Karma, Funding the Commons, Stellar, Blockful, Octant, Raid Guild, and the University of Malta. We are looking to have 12 core facilitators so that we have 3 people committed to covering each day + the teammates to support individual sessions each day.

When considering the teammates, those committing to running/moderating at least a single session during the 4 days, our representation includes: Impact Gardens, Open Source Observer, Fracton Ventures Research, Voice Deck DAO, and Morph. We will also be inviting top grant programs to be included in the first day, as well as many other individuals and orgs to be part of the programming over the 4 days to ensure there is a continuous series of quality conversations or small workshops.

## Core Facilitators
- Eugene Leventhal
- Mahesh Murthy

## Teammates
- LauNaMu
- Carl Cervone
- Devansh Mehta
- Azeem Khan
- James Kieran

The project at the core of organizing this hub would be Metagov, a research nonprofit that is itself a collective of researchers. The collaborators work across many different projects and we have already run multiple events (see takeaways from the Web3 Grant Summit from February and the July Grant Operator workshop) where we create no-shill spaces that are free of marketing. Metagov will work closely with the Cartography Syndicate group, another collective, to make sure that we bring together a few dozen relevant organizations and individuals to focus on improving the experience for grantees.

The Metagov team will run another Grant Operator Workshop right before DevCon, so will have many takeaways and learnings to share with the wider community of grantees. We will also invite grant operators and other relevant individuals to join specific sessions.

List the equipment or production needs (see what’s possible in the RFP)
The production would be light weight and wouldn’t require more than some whiteboards and screens, as well as whatever furniture would be available for seating for small group discussions

# Operational Requirements & Ownership
1. What actions are required to implement the proposal at Devcon(nect)?
2. Who will be responsible for the proposal to be implemented effectively? (i.e. working on Day 0)
3. What other projects could this proposal be integrated with? (Bonus points for collaboration across teams :))

The Core Facilitators will plan 4 days of programming for anyone to partake in at the Hub in Bangkok. We will share a revised calendar on the forum. 

We do not need any other support aside from setting the up the space with the required equipment. Eugene can be the main point of contact to coordinate with the others. We have an organizer telegram group and we can add someone from the Devcon team there if helpful. 

The Core Facilitators will divide the 4 days in terms of programming and coverage during the week. We will also have the support of the Teammates in ensuring consistent coverage. 

There might be some collaboration with the Collective Intelligence Community Hub. We're happy to work with anyone interested in improving grant programs, so reach out / come say hi if you're keen!
